My interests in research were shaped by my training as medical laboratory scientist, my work at the Minnesota Department of Health refugee and international health program (RIH), and my graduate training in epidemiology and biostatistics at the university of Minnesota. 

I am currently applying my data analyst skills to the implementation of analysis pipelines designed to model the association between the gut microbiota and drug metabolism in kidney transplant recipients.

In my role at the University of Minnesota, I analyzed the association between a potential immune related biomarker and the incidence of pancreatic cancer, resulting in 2 publications and helping secure grant funding for further research in a larger cohort. 

I have used my project management skills to collaborate on the database management of the adoption medicine clinic at the university of Minnesota and contributed to the production of the Minnesota department of health adoptee summary report. 

I am interested in the applications of microbial ecology and metagenomics to longitudinal analyses of immune related chronic diseases. Moreover, I am also interested in the development of prediction models by using in-vitro microbiome experiments to supplement our current understanding of microbial community composition, organization, and function. A repository of various research projects I've had the opportunity to contribute to can be found at https://github.com/guillonyeaghala/Research-Work
